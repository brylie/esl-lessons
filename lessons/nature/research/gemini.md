**I. Title Slide**

**(Display slide with titles and optional image)**

* **English Title:** Let's Talk About Nature in Finland  
* **Finnish Title:** Keskustellaan Suomen luonnosta

**Facilitator Note:**

* Clearly state the titles in both English and Finnish to welcome participants and set a bilingual context.  
* **Accessibility:** If using an image (e.g., a typical Finnish lake scene with forests), describe it verbally for everyone, paying particular attention to the visually impaired student. Example description: "This first slide shows our topic: *Let's Talk About Nature in Finland / Keskustellaan Suomen luonnosta*. There is a picture of a calm blue lake surrounded by a green forest with tall pine trees and white birch trees under a clear sky."  
* Using both languages from the start helps reduce learner anxiety and acknowledges their native language, fostering a supportive environment for practicing English.

**II. Icebreaker Question**

**Facilitator Note:**

* Read the question clearly in English first, pause, then read the Finnish translation. Allow participants sufficient time to think and formulate their answers in English. Encourage simple, brief responses to start the conversation comfortably.  
* This question aims to elicit positive personal connections to nature, a strong theme in Finnish culture, making it a culturally relevant and engaging starting point. Focusing on "enjoyment" also subtly introduces the theme of appreciating nature, linking to simple Earth Day ideas. Asking for just "one thing" makes it manageable for conversational learners.  
* **English:** What is one thing you enjoy about nature in Finland?  
* **Finnish:** Mikä on yksi asia, josta nautit Suomen luonnossa?
